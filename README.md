# <p align="center">Spotty-API</p>

## <p align="center">Spotify REST API written in Typescript</p>

<p align="center">Simple wrapper around calls to the Spotify REST API, using the fetch API under the hood.</p>

<div markdown="1" align="center">More information on the endpoints used can be found [here](/https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/) on Spotify's developer portal</div>

## <p align="center"> **Note** </p>
<p align="center">The project is still under heavy construction. So far the only thing that's been implemented is a client which handles the security token and basic calls to the general endspoints.</p>
